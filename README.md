# Soccer-Tournament-Simulator
Welcome to Andres's Soccer (Football) Tournament Simulator! This simulator will eventually be able to predict tournament results involving teams from the top leagues. This simulator will be eventually able to handle league and straight knockout formats as well as the popular group + knockout format used in some cups. This simulator is coded so that you can customize each tournament to include any team, although it is preferred that you include teams found in the data as they will produce more accurate results.

This project is a solo project by Andres (me).
